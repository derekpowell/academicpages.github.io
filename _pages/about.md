I'm a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University, working under Ellen Markman. I earned my PhD in Cognitive Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles under advisor Keith Holyoak. I was born and raised in Wauwatosa, WI and previously educated in the desert at Arizona State University. I love coffee and beer and have recently become an amateur coffee roaster and home brewer (emphasis on amateur). I also dabble in photography.

# My Research

Through experiments and computational cognitive modeling, my research program examines inter- actions within systems of beliefs, which I view as central to understanding higher-level cognition and behavior. I have come to focus on two important questions: (1) why are misconceptions so widespread and stubbornly resistant to change? and (2) why does our knowledge and awareness of facts so often fail to translate into optimal behavior? I have chosen to examine these questions in domains with the potential for positive real-world impacts, including health and science education.

My research has been published in top-tier psychology and general-interest journals, including *PNAS*, *Psychological Science*, and *Psychological Bulletin*.
