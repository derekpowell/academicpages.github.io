I'm a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University, working under Ellen Markman. I earned my PhD in Cognitive Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles under advisor Keith Holyoak. I was born and raised in Wauwatosa, WI and previously educated in the desert at Arizona State University. I love coffee and beer and have recently become an amateur coffee roaster and home brewer (emphasis on amateur). I also dabble in photography.

# My Research

My research asks how our beliefs are formed, how they are revised, and how they fit together with one another into larger systems. Through experiments and computational cognitive modeling, I work to examine interactions within systems of beliefs, which I view as central to understanding higher-level cognition and behavior.

My work has been published in top-tier psychology and general-interest journals, including *PNAS*, *Psychological Science*, and *Psychological Bulletin*.
